# Introduction to the CPR package and Programmatic Construction of Calls
## A Presentation to the Denver R Users Group

This repository contains the slides and example scripts presented to the [Denver
R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/240713454/).

First, the cpr: (control polygon reduction) R package will be introduced. The
cpr package provides a set of tools for working with uni- and multi-variable
B-splines, and most importantly, efficiently finding parsimonious B-spline
regression models with high quality of fit.

You can download the cpr package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpr) or from
[github](https://github.com/dewittpe/cpr).

After the overview of the cpr package we will explore some of the tools in R
used to make the package work.  Specifically, we'll explore the use of

* `match.fun`,
* `stats::update`,
* `formulas`, and
* environments.
